 * The two steps of placing an area (PM-02a, PM-02b, PM-02d), shared by the player's cast sheet and the master's dialog.
 *
 * - Step 1 ("Onde ela explode", "Para onde?"): the browser draws the outline while the point moves, and asks nothing. Once a
 *   point or a direction is placed (a tap, Enter, a pick in "Centrar em…"), the server is asked who is inside
 *   (`PreviewSpellArea`, read-only): its squares replace the outline, its point is the effective one (the near side of a
 *   wall), and the warnings come from its list. Only the answer for the latest place counts.
 * - Confirming opens step 2 ("Quem está na área") with that answer; "Mudar o local" goes back with the point where it was.
 *
 * Nothing is spent until the cast itself, and the server works the area out again then. A sphere centered on the caster has
 * nothing to place: `start()` goes straight to its list.
