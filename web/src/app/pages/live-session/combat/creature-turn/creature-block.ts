/**
 * One creature of the player on the page of its turn (MR-037, E9-12 states 3 and 6): the picture, the name, its
 * hit points (the owner's and the master's; RN-20) and armor class (the book's: the combat never sends an armor
 * class to a player), the state of its part in a joint turn, its action and its movement, then what it can do:
 *   - a creature that attacks: its attacks with "Atacar" and "Mover o Lobo atroz 1";
 *   - a familiar, which does not attack: "O familiar não ataca. Ele usa as outras ações:" and the standard actions;
 *   - the familiar of the Pacto da Corrente, which attacks with its reaction: a "Reação" row with "Atacar".
 * Each creature has its own action and its own movement: attacking with one never spends another's. Off its turn
 * every button is off with the reason in a line. The numbers and the lists are what the server sent (`GetTurnOptions`
 * on the creature); nothing is worked out here.
