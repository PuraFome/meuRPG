 * "2 de 3", the pips (up to 6 uses; above that only the number) and when it comes back; then a row for each spell
 * level with its pips and "3 de 4" ("criado" beside the count of a slot Flexible Casting made), the pact slots as
 * their own row, and when they come back. Read-only: nothing here takes focus (the master adjusts from the
 * character's card on the session page). The numbers are the live ones, which the sheet page keeps current while the
 * campaign has an open session. A section with nothing to show is not drawn.
