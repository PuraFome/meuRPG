 * creatures (the character sheet, the campaign's list) reads again when the
 * master gives some or a creature arrives. It is the session page's own stream client (`LiveStream`, ADR-0005's
 * rules: backoff, closed when the tab is hidden, no reconnect when there is no
 * access) over `LiveSessionSourceLive`, not a copy of it. One stream at a time;
 * `follow(null)` closes it, which the page does when it goes away. Provided at
 * the sheet's route, so the generated play client stays in that lazy chunk.
