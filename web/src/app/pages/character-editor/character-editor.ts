/**
 * The character editor (MR-003, MR-005, MR-006): a stepper for a full
 * sheet (player, enemy, boss) — Básico, Habilidades, Perícias, Escolhas, Magias
 * (only for a caster class), Equipamento, `EditorStepper` over the CDK stepper —
 * or a single short form for a basic sheet (minion, story, `NpcShortForm`),
 * routed from three places (plan §5):
 *
 * - `/campaigns/:id/characters/new` — a player creates their character.
 * - `/campaigns/:id/npcs/new/:kind` — a master creates an NPC.
 * - `/campaigns/:id/characters/:characterId/edit` — either edits.
 *
 * The submit action sits outside the stepper, right under the open step,
 * so the whole form can be saved from any step. A submit with an invalid
 * field lists what to fix (`invalidSummary`), marks the steps that have
 * one, and opens the first of them. RN-01 is enforced on the server: this
 * page opens an existing character only when `Character.can_edit` says the
 * caller may save it (otherwise it shows why, as `character-sheet` does),
 * and still renders whatever `describeCharacterError` maps a
 * `failed_precondition` / `SHEET_LOCKED` response to, for a sheet locked
 * while the form was open. No D&D rule runs here: the page never shows a
 * modifier, CA or PV it computed itself.
 *
 * The page owns the two forms, the page state and the signals the plain
 * classes share, and builds the plain classes that hold the rest:
 * `EditorPicks` and `SpellPicks` (what is picked beside the form's controls),
 * `EditorCatalog` (the lists and the views over catalog and form),
 * `EditorDraft` (the draft and what is wrong with it), `EditorServerDraft`
 * (what the server derives from the draft), `SaveFlow` and `EditorSubmit`
 * (the save), `EditorLoader` (opening a route) and `EditorSpellDetails`.
 * The template binds those members directly (`views.blocks()`,
 * `picks.toggleSkill($event)`, `server.pendingSteps()`), so a member is
 * documented on the class that owns it; the page keeps only what needs the
 * component itself: the route, the step and choice-group view children, the
 * subclass and XP effects and the block and class-change handlers.
 *
 * Race, subrace, class, subclass, background, skills, armor, weapons,
 * cantrips and spells are picked from `RulesCatalogVm`
 * (`ContentService.ListContent`): `namePt` shown, `key` sent, never typed as
 * free text, since a typed name almost never matches the real key.
