import "slices"

// The area of a spell (SRD 5.1, "Areas of Effect"). A shape is drawn on the grid
// from its point of origin, and a square is inside it when the square's center
// is (a creature standing on a square is in the area when its square is).
//
//   - A sphere and a cylinder are centered on a point, which is a square the
//     caster chooses, and the origin is inside it. A cylinder's height does not
//     matter on a flat map, so it is a circle like the sphere's. The radius is
//     the shape's size.
//   - A cone and a line begin at the caster, who picks a direction; the caster's
//     own square is not inside (the SRD's origin is inside only if the caster
//     says so). A cone is as wide at a point as that point is far from the origin
//     (SRD): at two squares it is two squares wide. A line is as long as the
//     size and as wide as the width (5 ft unless a spell says another).
//   - A cube has its origin on a face; from the caster it touches the caster's
//     square by a face (a straight direction) or by a corner (a diagonal one), and
//     it is size × size.
//
// The directions are the eight a grid has (each 45 degrees), not an angle: the
// SRD does not say how to lay a cone or a line on squares, so a table needs one
// way that is the same on every device. Distances are exact (the squares are
// counted between centers, a diagonal is longer), unlike the range of a spell,
// which RangeFt rounds down (RN-21), so that a 4-square sphere does not grow by a
// square.
