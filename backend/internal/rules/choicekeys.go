// How a pick is written in Build.FeatureChoices.
//
// An option of a feature or trait (a fighting style, a pact boon, an
// invocation, a dragon ancestry) is written as its own key, which already says
// where it belongs. A pick that is not a feature (a favored enemy's type and
// language, a terrain, the half-elf's abilities, a spell a feature grants) is
// written "<choice key>=<value key>", so the choice it answers is never a
// guess: two favored enemies that both speak Giant are two different strings,
// and a spell is never taken for another feature's.
