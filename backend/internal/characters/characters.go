// Package characters manages a campaign's characters: the players'
// characters and the master's NPCs, their sheets and stories, and the
// master's private notes (MR-003, MR-004, MR-005, MR-006; RN-01, RN-03,
// RN-04, RN-11, RN-16). It also serves ContentService, the rules catalog the
// character editor offers, until the table's own content has a home of its
// own (ADR-0008).
//
// The sheet and the story are stored as JSON documents: the protojson of
// charactersv1.CharacterSheet and charactersv1.CharacterStory. Derived
// numbers are never stored; package rules computes them on every read
// (rules.Derive), and checks every sheet before it is written
// (rules.Validate).
//
// Who may do what is decided at the start of every handler with package
// authz, from the caller's role in the campaign (ADR-0011). A player sees
// only their own characters; everything else is "not found" to them, so NPC
// IDs never leak.
//
// Invites with approval (RN-15, MR-024). A pending member (package authz,
// pending.go) may create one player character, which starts 'pending', and
// read and edit it while they wait; they see nothing else. The master
// approves it (ApproveCharacter: the character becomes a draft and the
// membership active) or rejects it (RejectCharacter: both are deleted), in
// one transaction that also touches campaign_members through
// PendingMembers, which package campaigns implements (approval.go).
//
// A pending member who has not created a character is removed after 30
// days (campaign_members.pending_expires_at, migration 00035). Creating the
// character clears that deadline in the same transaction (CreateCharacter).
// Package campaigns calls ApprovePendingCharacter when an ordinary invite
// promotes a pending member (approval.go).
//
// The sheet lock (RN-01) is set by package play when a game session starts,
// through LockSheets, inside play's own transaction. The vitals (RN-02:
// current hit points, spell slots and hit dice used, table
// character_vitals) are kept here too, and package play reads and corrects
// them during a session through ListVitals, GetVitals and AdjustVitals
// (vitals.go). Neither package imports the other: cmd/api connects them.
//
// The SQL lives in queries.sql, and sqlc turns it into package charactersdb.
// Every write runs inside db.InTx, which retries CockroachDB's serialization
// errors (40001).
