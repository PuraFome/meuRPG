// Package progression is how the characters grow (MR-016, RN-09, RN-12): the
// XP the master gives the party (ProgressionService), by the defeated enemies
// of a combat, by gold or by an amount the master picks, the milestones the
// master marks, the history of both (the whole campaign reads it, question
// 50) and who can go up a level.
//
// An award writes each character's share into the XP on its sheet, in the same
// transaction, through a Party interface the characters module implements
// (characters.Service.AddExperience), like play's VitalsKeeper: the sheet is
// the characters module's. The combat's defeated NPCs and the session's log
// are play's, reached through Combats and SessionLog. The campaign's XP mode
// is campaigns'. cmd/api connects them; no package imports another's
// internals. The tables (xp_awards, xp_award_shares) are this module's, and,
// like session_events, they are never rewritten: an undo sets undone_at and
// takes the XP back through the sheets (ADR-0007).
//
// The other way round, the characters module asks LevelUpReason whether a
// character can go up a level, for GetCharacter's can_level_up (RN-12).
//
// The SQL lives in queries.sql, and sqlc turns it into package progressiondb.
// Every write runs inside db.InTx, which retries CockroachDB's serialization
// errors (40001).
