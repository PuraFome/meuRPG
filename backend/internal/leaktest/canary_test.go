// A canary is a string the master wrote into a hidden thing, or a secret the
// master's data holds. The leak tests look for every canary in every answer a
// player gets. Three kinds of needle, chosen so that none of them can turn up
// in an answer by chance:
//
//   - a marker, "LEAKCANARY-<kind>-<n>", written into every free-text field of a
//     hidden thing (a word that exists nowhere else, never a short word or hex);
//   - an id of a hidden entity (the exact UUID);
//   - a secret number, a number that the master's data holds and that a player must
//     never read in a numeric field (an NPC with 4,321 hit points, a trap DC of 29).
//     Numbers are compared in the decoded answer, field by field, never in the
//     JSON text, where "29" could be a part of anything.
//
// What a player may legitimately read is not a canary: a thing the master showed
// (an opened scene's name, a shown puzzle's clue) is registered as "public" so
// the test can prove, by a positive control, that the player's read works.

// markerPrefix starts every marker. It is not hex and not a word.
