// switched options on or off. The hint carries nothing (RN-10): each app reads the
// content again as its own role. At most one goes out per campaign every 250 ms
// (the puzzles' gate), the last change never left unannounced, and one that waits
// in a stream's queue is not queued twice. Call it after the commit.
