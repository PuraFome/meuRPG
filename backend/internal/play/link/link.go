// Package link holds the small plain types that cross the borders between
// the play module and the modules it reads while it runs a combat: the
// characters module (who can fight, with which numbers) and the maps module
// (the grid, the battle point, the tokens).
//
// Modules never import each other's code (docs/arquitetura.md), and the
// numbers a combat needs are not API messages, so the types both sides
// agree on live here, in a package that imports nothing of the project.
// Package play declares the interfaces (CombatRoster, MapKeeper) that use
// them; cmd/api connects the real services.

// from the sheet, derived by the rules module for a full sheet, and read
// as they are for a basic one.
