// The racial advantages on saving throws that hold against one kind of source (Brave, Fey Ancestry, Gnome Cunning,
// Dwarven Resilience, SRD 5.1) apply when the save says what it is against (combat.SaveScene.Against). The app knows
// the source of a spell's save, of the save of an effect that lasts and of a trap's save; a save asked with no source
// (a concentration save, a save the master asks) keeps the sheet's reminder, and the master decides.
