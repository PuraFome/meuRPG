// transaction of the last answer, as the action's own call would have run, with
// what the answers changed: a Counterspell that fails the spell, a Cutting Words
// die taken off a roll, half the damage of an Uncanny Dodge. Nothing is spent and
// nothing is rolled before the replay, so a held action that is dropped (the combat
// ended, or what it needed is gone) leaves no trace.
